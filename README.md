# Machine Learning

## Machine Learning vs. Artificial Intelligence

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence. Is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. Using algorithms that iteratively learn from data, machine learning allows computers to find hidden insights without being explicitly programmed where to look.

## Machine Learning vs. Statistics

Machine learning is foucsed on prediction and inference, while statistics is focused on estimation and hypothesis testing (explaining the data).

## Variables Types

- Ordinal: Categorical variable with an order, e.g. low, medium, high
- Nominal: Categorical variable without an order, e.g. red, blue, green
- Continuous: Numerical variable with an infinite number of possible values, e.g. height, weight
- Discrete: Numerical variable with a finite number of possible values, e.g. number of children
